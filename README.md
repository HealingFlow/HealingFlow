- 👋 Hi, I’m @HealingFlow, and I gratefully celebrate the Healing Flow of Life every day. 
- 👀 I’m interested in helping IT professionals remain healthy throughout their entire careers, so they can enjoy years of retirement. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the many doctors, osteopaths, naturopaths and alternative therapists in the Colorado Front-range.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on connecting all of these great members of our Healing Community!
- 📫 How to reach me by emailing me at HealingFlowClasses@gmail.com
